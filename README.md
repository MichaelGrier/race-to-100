# race-to-100
A small math game that I coded for my students to play. Helps to develop number sense and probability skills.

**this app is not fully optimized for mobile devices**

### What I learned:
- creation and implementation of modals,
- basic dom manipulation using querySelector() and getElementById() methods,
- initialization functions
